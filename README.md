# Weather Application
Created a simple weather application using html , css and js .
By giving city name in input field you will get the realtime weather data ,
and if you wanna get your current weather data using your current location
you can do that to , So using geolocation api which is inbuilt in moderns browsers ,
I get latitude and longitude of that area and then i simply fetch api , with those lat, 
and lon . 
With adding media queries and using percentage (%) unit, relative units like , vh , vw , em ,
rem , and use px also sometime .
